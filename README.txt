The objective of this project was to create, prune and evaluate a decision tree for classification to predict what room a signal reading is taken from, it was trained using the wifi_db datasets.

This was achieved using only Python and Numpy, as well as matplotlib to visualise the tree pre and post pruning. The group worked on this project using PyCharm's code-with-me plugin, allowing us to simultaneously code on the same file using a member of the group's IDE as the host.
